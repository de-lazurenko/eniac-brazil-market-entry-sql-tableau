# Brazilian Market Entry Analysis: Eniac & Magist Partnership

## 📌 Project Overview
Eniac, a European tech retailer, is considering a 3-year partnership with **Magist**, a Brazilian SaaS platform, to expand into the Latin American market. 

**The Goal:** Evaluate if Magist is a suitable partner for Eniac’s high-end tech portfolio and if their logistics meet Eniac's "fast delivery" brand promise.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** SQL (MySQL)
* **Visualization:** Tableau
* **Tools:** GitHub,Presentation (Slides)
* **Domain:** E-commerce, Logistics, Market Analysis

## 📊 Business Questions & Insights

### 1. Product Catalog Fit
* **Question:** Does Magist have a significant presence in the Tech sector?
* **Insight:** Analysis shows that the "Tech" segment accounts for approximately 16% of total sales. This indicates that while the category has volume, it is among the top three cheapest categories at Magist, suggesting a mass-market rather than a premium positioning.

### 2. Geographical Reach
* **Question:** Where are the customers and sellers located?
* **Insight:** There is a heavy concentration (**42% of orders**) in the state of **São Paulo**. While this simplifies initial logistics, it indicates limited reach in other Brazilian regions.

### 3. Logistics & Delivery Performance
* **Question:** Can Magist deliver fast enough?
* **Insight:** Currently, only **1.38%** of deliveries meet the strict "fast delivery" expectations, with an average delivery time of **14 days** compared to Eniac's 3-day target.

## 💡 Final Recommendation
Based on the logistics performance and tech-segment concentration, the recommendation is to **Do not sign the deal. Magist's 14-day delivery speed and low average order value (154 BRL) directly conflict with Eniac's premium brand and "3-day delivery" promise.**.
